Independent Set verifier: ISverifier (2014)

ISverifier verifies whether the given solution (a vertex set) is an independent set for the given graph.

Note that the binary in this fold is compiled under 64-bit Linux OS system.
If you are not under such an OS system, please compile the codes under your own machine.

1. Format of graph file and solution file
=========================================

1.1 The graph file is asked to be in DIMACS ascii format for undirected graphs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A small exmple is given as follow:

c nodes: 4, edges: 3
c the lines begin with a 'c' are comment lines and are not considered by the solvers.
c the graph data begin with a 'p' line that in the format as: p edge <number of vertices> <number of edges>,
c followed by all 'e' lines.
p edge 4 3
e 1 2
e 1 3
e 2 4

1.2 The input solution file should be in the following format (illustrated by a small exmple).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c the lines begin with a 'c' are comment lines and are not considered by the solvers.
c the solution begin with a 'p' line that in the format as: p size <number of vertices>,
c followed by vertices.
p size 10
1 2 4 5 7 9 10 14 16 20

2. Usage
============================================

The command to run ISverifier is: ./ISverifier <graph file> <solution file> <option parameter>

The last parameter is about output option when the solution is not an independent set. It should be either -all or -single, where -all lists all conflict edges  and -single terminates the progame once it finds an conflict edge.
